In this project, I'm building up a server and a client application in node.

What the application does isn't really important to me, I'm using it to develop my skills and knowledge in a number of areas such as:
 - Devops: Using Docker, Kubernetes, nginx etc
 - CI/CD: Specifically building up pieplines and using plugins in Jenkins
 - Using a front end framework, probably React
 - CSS
 - Using Jest, with TDD
 - SOLID
